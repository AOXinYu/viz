## FAQ

## Why Did You Create Viz?

Viewing raw stats and tables only tell you **part of a story**.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/yB9hv18.png)

`Viz` helps tell the rest of the story with **interactive visualizations** that are **continually updated**.

## How Do We Help With or Stay Up-To-Date With the Evolution of Viz?

`Viz` is just getting started.  [Contributions](https://www.github.com/donnemartin/viz/CONTRIBUTING) and [feedback](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/issues) are welcome!

Feel free to [follow](https://www.github.com/donnemartin), [star](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/fork), [fork](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/fork), and check back for updates.

## Why Isn't the Online Interactive Viz Loading?

The visualization hosting service might be having issues:  [View Status](https://trust.tableau.com/status/tableau-public).

<a name="can-i-viz-offline"></a>
## Can I Viz Offline?

Yes, you'll need the **free** [Reader](http://www.tableau.com/products/reader).  Download and run the latest [Viz Workbook](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/tree/master/viz).

Depending on your setup, you might see improved performance running `viz` locally.

## Can We See Visualizations in JavaScript, Python, R or ...?

Sure, please [contribute](https://www.github.com/donnemartin/viz/CONTRIBUTING)! :)

## What Data Is Tracked?

Although [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending) is a **great tool to discover up-and-coming projects**, it only allows you to review up to **one month** of data.  Third-party sites often show **all-time stats** that are **relatively static**, as they are dominated by well-established repos.

`Viz` is meant to supplement existing solutions by **filtering only on the newest, most popular repos** created within a specific timeframe.

***For example, `Viz` 2015 will only track repos created within the year 2015.***

## Can We See Stats for Time Ranges Other Than 2015?

For the initial launch, `Viz` provides stats for 2015.

**Visualizations for 6-, 3-, and 1-month ranges are under development**.  The data for each range will be continually updated to keep `Viz` fresh.

## Can We See Stats for 'Older' Repos?

In the future, `Viz` can be extended to track repos regardless of creation date.  [Feedback](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/issues) is welcome!

## How Do You Mine Data?

`Viz` is powered by the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) through [github3.py](https://github.com/sigmavirus24/github3.py) and leverages the following:

* [`pandas`](https://github.com/pydata/pandas) and [`numpy`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) in the following [IPython Notebook](https://github.com/ipython/ipython) for data wrangling.
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/?hl=en) through [`geocoder`](https://github.com/DenisCarriere/geocoder) for location data.
* [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/) for visualizations.*

**Interested in visualizations with JavaScript, Python, R, or ...?  [Contribute](https://www.github.com/donnemartin/viz/CONTRIBUTING)!*

## When Did You Mine the 2015 Data?

The `Viz` 2015 stats were mined on `January 1, 2016, between 00:00 to 01:00 PDT`, and are preserved [here](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/tree/master/language_stats/2015_frozen).

## Where Do We Find the Data?

* [Data](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/tree/master/githubstats/data)
* [Data Tables](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/tree/master/language_stats)
* [Tableau Workbooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/tree/master/viz)

## Why Are My 2015 Manual Search Results Different From Viz 2015?

With [GitHub Search](https://github.com/search), you can manually run queries similar to what you would get from the GitHub API.

To view the most-starred JavaScript repos created in 2015, run the following [query](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=created%3A2015-01-01..2015-12-31+stars%3A%3E%3D100+language%3Ajavascript&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults):

    created:2015-01-01..2015-12-31 stars:>=100 language:javascript

To check stats for a user's or an org's repos that were created in 2015, run:

    created:2015-01-01..2015-12-31 stars:>=100 user:user_name

Star counts from the searches above will show data up to the time you performed the search.

## Why Restrict Search Results to `stars:>=100` for Viz 2015?

Only repos with `stars:>=100` are tracked to help filter GitHub's rapidly growing **30+ million** repositories and to keep within the [GitHub API rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/).

`Viz` 6-, 3-, and 1-month might loosen this restriction as there should be less repos to analyze.  [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) along with [GitHub Archive](https://www.githubarchive.org/) could also supplement the GitHub API.

## Why Stars and Forks?

`Viz` provides stats for repos, users, and orgs by stars (and in many cases, forks).  **Stars and forks are *not* perfect metrics**, yet they are **simple and fairly effective measures of interest**.  For a more detailed discussion on measuring repo popularity, check out ["On the Popularity of GitHub Applications:
 A Preliminary Note"](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz/blob/master/assets/viz.pdf) which concludes:

>The number of stars of a system tends to correlate not only with the number of forks, but
also with its effective usage by other client applications, which reinforces the importance
of stars as a real measure of a systemâ€™s popularity.

In the future, other stats such as issues, pull requests, followers gained, etc could be included.

## How Are Stats for Users and Orgs Calculated?

To provide stats for users and orgs, `Viz` groups stars and forks by user or org.  Note the `stars:>=100` restriction still applies.

## What Languages Are Tracked?

`Viz` tracks the most popular languages on GitHub plus the `Unknown` language option.  Repo languages are identified by [github/linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist).
